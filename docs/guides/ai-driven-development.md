# AI-Driven Development Guide

## Overview

AI-driven development is an iterative approach that leverages AI assistants for code generation, review, and improvement while maintaining human oversight and quality control.

## Development Cycle

### 1. Task Creation
- Use the backlog template to create clear, focused tasks
- Include context, requirements, and acceptance criteria
- Break down complex features into manageable chunks

### 2. AI Interaction
- Start with high-level requirements
- Provide clear context and constraints
- Use iterative refinement:
  1. Initial implementation
  2. Code review and feedback
  3. Refinement and optimization

### 3. Quality Control
- Review AI-generated code thoroughly
- Run tests and quality checks
- Document key decisions and trade-offs

## Best Practices

### Task Structure
```markdown
# Task Title

## Context
[Background information and current state]

## Requirements
- Functional requirement 1
- Functional requirement 2

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Criterion 1
- [ ] Criterion 2

## Technical Notes
- Dependencies
- Constraints
- Performance requirements
```

### AI Communication
1. **Be Specific**
   - Provide clear requirements
   - Specify constraints upfront
   - Include relevant context

2. **Iterative Refinement**
   - Start with basic implementation
   - Review and provide feedback
   - Request specific improvements

3. **Code Quality**
   - Request tests and documentation
   - Ask for error handling
   - Review security implications

### Example Workflow

1. **Initial Request**
   ```
   Create a function that validates user input with these requirements:
   - Check email format
   - Minimum password length: 8 chars
   - Required fields: name, email, password
   ```

2. **Review & Refine**
   ```
   The implementation looks good, but please:
   - Add input sanitization
   - Include unit tests
   - Document error cases
   ```

3. **Finalize**
   ```
   Great! Now let's:
   - Add JSDoc comments
   - Handle edge cases
   - Optimize performance
   ```

## Common Pitfalls

1. **Unclear Requirements**
   - ❌ "Make it better"
   - ✅ "Add error handling for network timeouts"

2. **Missing Context**
   - ❌ "Fix the bug"
   - ✅ "Fix the login timeout issue by increasing the retry limit"

3. **Scope Creep**
   - ❌ "Add all possible validations"
   - ✅ "Add email and password validation as specified"

## Measuring Success

- Code quality metrics
- Test coverage
- Documentation completeness
- Development velocity
- Bug reduction

## Tools and Integration

1. **Version Control**
   - Clear commit messages
   - Feature branches
   - PR templates

2. **Documentation**
   - ADRs for key decisions
   - Updated README files
   - API documentation

3. **Quality Assurance**
   - Automated tests
   - Code review guidelines
   - Performance benchmarks
